    Create a modern, personal portfolio website with the following specifications:

üß± GENERAL STRUCTURE

    Use HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript (or React if preferred).

    The website should follow a dark theme with a toggleable light/dark mode.

    The layout should be responsive for both desktop and mobile.

    Use a two-layer design:

        Background layer: A subtle grid pattern across the whole page (like graph paper).

        Foreground layer: An interactive content box with sections like About, Projects, Skills, Setup, and Contact.

üß© FEATURES & DESIGN
1. Navigation Bar (Top Centered)

    A horizontal nav bar centered at the top with links: about, projects, skills, setup, contact.

    Smooth scroll to each section.

    A small theme toggle button at the top-right labeled ‚Äúlight‚Äù or ‚Äúdark‚Äù.

2. Hero Section

    Bold name in large font (e.g., aarav gupta).

    Subtext below: 14-year-old developer from India.

    Below that, clickable links to:

        mail (mailto link),

        github (external),

        linkedin (external).

3. About Section

    Section title in bold (like about).

    Description paragraph with a friendly, tech-focused tone (see image):

        Talk about interests in coding, automation scripts, web/game dev, and open-source.

        Mention a love for learning new programming languages and collaborating.

4. Grid Background

    Implement a CSS grid pattern:

        Use ::before or background-image with CSS gradients or SVG.

        Fixed to the body and behind all content.

        Low contrast (e.g., very dark gray on black).

5. Typography & Font

    Use monospace fonts for tech feel (like Fira Code, JetBrains Mono, or Courier New).

    Headings bold, section titles slightly larger.

    Body text light-gray on black background for readability.

üåê EXTRAS

    Add hover effects to nav links and social/contact links.

    Add basic animations (fade-in or slide-up) on scroll using CSS or JS.

    Highlight active section in navbar as user scrolls.

    Optionally store theme preference in localStorage.
